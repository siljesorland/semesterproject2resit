# Semester Project 2 Resit 

## Goal 

To create a wiki-style tool for storing information about front-end development. 

## Brief 

You have been tasked with creating a wiki-style website for front-end developers to store information about coding including syntax, and examples of how to create elements for a site. 

Here are a list of functional requirements: 
- All users should be able to see a list of posts. 
- All users should be able to search for a specific post. You can use client-side filtering, or use the search parameter on the API itself.  
- A user should be able to log in 
- A user who hasn’t logged in shouldn’t be able to edit any of the entries on the site. 
- A logged in user should be able to create a post 
- A logged in user should be able to update a post 
- A logged in user should be able to delete a post 

WordPress is used as a headless CMS to manage the content.
